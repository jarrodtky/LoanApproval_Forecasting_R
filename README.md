## Project Overview
- Development of a binary classification model to predict loan approval status using [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).
- Application of data preprocessing techniques to handle outliers, missing values, and feature engineering.
- Evaluation of model performance based on different training and testing data split ratios.



## Motivation
- The challenge faced by lending institutions in determining loan eligibility, especially for small businesses and individuals without an established credit history.
- The need to incorporate non-traditional data sources and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to improve loan approval predictions.



### Aim & Objectives
- **Aim:** 
	- To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of loan approval predictions using a dataset of loan applications.
- **Objectives:** 
	- Evaluate and preprocess the loan dataset to ensure quality and suitability for the analysis.
  - Develop a binary classification model, particularly using Random Forest, to predict loan approval status based on various borrower attributes.
  - Compare the impact of different data split ratios on the performance of the Random Forest model.
